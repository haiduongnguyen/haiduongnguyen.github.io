Here is the part that I records my journey where I build this project.  
I choose new plan for this project - for me it will be way of working in future: do by ChatGPT guide.  
But I must note some key point of this:  
- Chat GPT told me that I should code 70%, GPT will help 30%. This ratio will made me do on my own to pass my master defence. 
- Chat GPT will act as a professor to guide me, not work for me


So here is my journey:
1. [Chat GPT first assignment - before coding](/1. chat_gpt_first_assigments)
