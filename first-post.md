# Why I started this website

I created this website to document my learning journey in data analytics
and machine learning.

Instead of listing skills on a CV, I want to explain:
- how I think
- how I solve real problems
- what I learned from real data

## What I will write about

- Data analysis projects in banking
- Machine learning concepts (PCA, trees, boosting)
- Time series forecasting
- Lessons learned from real datasets

## Next step

My next post will document a real project:
**Metrics Anomaly Detection in Banking Systems**.
